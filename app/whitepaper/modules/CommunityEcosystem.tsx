        Holders unlock access to themed guilds—Sous, Spice, and Sauce—each specializing in curation, partnerships, and charitable
        initiatives. Guild achievements mint badge NFTs that boost governance weight and unlock behind-the-scenes streams.

        Seasonal quests feature collaborative art drops, meme hackathons, and IRL food relief missions. Treasury proposals fund
        the top-voted ideas, with progress tracked via transparent milestone dashboards.
